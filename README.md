# folk_music

The goal of this project is to use a natural language approach to classify the origin of a folk song. This repository contains a method for classification of over 10,000 folk songs from kernscores.com. It uses a 'bag-of-notes' approach with n-grams to create feature vectors used to classify the songs by origin. Check out the ipython notebooks as well as the final presentation! I will continue working on this project, testing different sources of sheet-music, creating a similarity metric for comapring sheet music, and testing new methods such as deep learning word2vec (note2vec).
