# folk_music

The goal of this project is to use a natural language approach to classifying origin of a folk song. This repository contains a method for classification of over 10,000 folk songs from kernscores.com. It uses a 'bag-of-notes' approach witih n-grams to create feature vectors used to classify the songs by origin. Check out the ipython notebooks as well as the final presentation!
